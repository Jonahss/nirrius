## Highlighted Work Experience

July 2013 to Present - **Cerego Japan Inc.**

**Lead Front End Developer**

Cerego creates products that make learning easier.
I work on iKnow, a spaced repetition software for language vocabulary.
iKnow's strength is its item scheduling system, heuristically designed to match the user's responses and create lasting memories.

* Refactored traditional **Ruby on Rails** application with **React** and **CoffeeScript**.
* Restructured hiring and development practices.
* **Recruited** and **mentored** engineers, **reducing 10 years of technical debt piecemeal**.

December 2012 to May 2013 - **Boardwalk.io**

**Product Lead**

Boardwalk is a personal website framework built to encourage vanity and sharing.
Users can create their own whiteboard to fill with blog posts and photos.
The layout is free form and custom to each user.
Boardwalk is **open source** and currently in beta testing.

* Built with **Backbone.js**, using **Ruby on Rails** as a backend.
* Content stored with **MongoDB**, using **Mongoid**.
* **Built to scale**. The client does the heavy lifting, while Rails acts a pipe to the database.

April 2012 to July 2012 - **Mango Languages Inc.**

**Project Manager**

Mango Languages specializes in language learning software for consumers and libraries.
Mango Languages contacted me to create a **Google Hangout application** called **Mango Skits**; a multiplayer game to be presented at **Google IO**.
